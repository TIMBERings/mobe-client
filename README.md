=====

MOBE (/mō-bē /) stands for **M**ock **O**ut **B**ack **E**nd.  It is inspired by [MSL](http://finraos.github.io/MSL/).  This tool allows a user to unit test the front end without relying on a back end, making tests faster and more reliable.  It also allows to test API contracts.

This client is made to be used with [mobe-server](http://github.com/TIMBERings/mobe-server).
